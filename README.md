# DSCOVR-ACE-Visualizer

This graph was designed to visualize the position of two space weather satellites launched by NOAA named ACE and DSCOVR. GSE (Geocentric solar ecliptic) coordinate data is being pulled from NASA's public api every time the page is loaded, giving a near real time visualiztion of the current satellite positions. Data points are parsed and filtered to increase the charts legibility and display one solar orbit (~6 months).
